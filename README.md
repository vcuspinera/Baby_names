# Baby names
Analysis of popular baby names in English and Spanish from public databases from the USA, Canada and Spain.

## Intro

Getting a name for a baby is not as trivial as people could think, or at least not for my wife and me. 

When we were expecting our first baby girl, during the last five months of the pregnancy, we looked for options of names on different sources as websites and books with popular baby names, websites with international names, asked recommendations between our friends, or even wrote down names of movies and tv series characters.

After months of searching names, on early April of 2021 we came with a list of our favorite names for the baby girl:

|Mom's choices| Dad's choices|
|:------------|:-------------|
|Elisa        |Aisha         |
|Macarena     |Amanda        |
|             |Carlina       |
|             |Gina          |
|             |Victoria      |

However, we didn't agree in a name for the baby. So, I started to wonder how we could make the best selection of the name for our baby? Which are the most popular names? Is there a way to measure how well a surname sounds combined with the family name?

## Databases of names
The first step was to look for names. In our case, because we live in Mexico we were interested on names in Spanish; however, we also were open for a name from an English speaking country. 

### Names in Spanish
I was interested in looking for a database of names in Mexico. I found that the _Registro Nacional de PoblaciÃ³n_ (National Population Registry) has this information, but it is not public available. 

However, I found that _Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica_ (Statistics National Institute) from __Spain__ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ has open data of the most popular 100 names in this country from 2002 to 2019, and also data of names with frequency equal to or greater than 20 people.

### Names in English
For names from English speaking countries, I found two databases of popular baby names: the first one from the U.S.A. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ published by the [Social Security Agency](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/), and the second one from British Columbia, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, shared by the [Government of B.C.](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/statistics-reports/bc-s-most-popular-baby-names).
