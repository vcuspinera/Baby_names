# Baby names
Analysis of popular baby names in Spain, the USA and Canada.

## Intro

Getting a name for your baby is not as trivial as people could think, or at least not for my wife and me. We are expecting our first baby, and we have been looking for names in different sources as websites and books with popular baby names, websites with intenational names, between our acquaintances first names, or even writing down names of movies and tv series characters.

After months of searching names, we have come with a list of favorite names for our baby girl:

|Mom's choices| Dad's choices|
|:------------|:-------------|
|Macarena     |Victoria      |
|Elisa        |Gina          |
|             |Aisha         |
|             |Amanda        |
|             |Carlina       |

However, until now we haven't agree in a name for our baby.

From this point, I was wondering how popular are these names, wich are the most popular names, and also look into possible compound names for our baby.

## Data
### Names in Spanish
I was interested in looking for a database of names in Mexico, and I found that the _Registro Nacional de PoblaciÃ³n_ (National Population Registry) had this information, but it is not available for the public. 

However, I found that _Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica_ (Statistics National Institute) from __Spain__ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ has open data of the most popular 100 names in this country from 2002 to 2019, and also data of names with frequency equal to or greater than 20 people.

### Names in English
I was also interested in names from English speaking countries, and found two databases of popular baby names: the first one with data from the U.S.A. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ published by the [Social Security Agency](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/), and the second one with data from British Columbia, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, shared by the [Government of B.C.](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/statistics-reports/bc-s-most-popular-baby-names).
